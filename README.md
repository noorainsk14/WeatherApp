📌 About the Project
This Weather App is a responsive and dynamic web application built with React. It fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays temperature, weather conditions (such as Rain, Haze, or Clear), and corresponding weather icons.

The application uses Redux for state management, allowing centralized control over weather data, loading states, and error handling. The user interface is styled using Material UI, ensuring a modern, consistent, and mobile-friendly design.
